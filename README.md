# Feedback-Form
 A generic feedback submission form with a small back end server built with ExpressJS for accepting requests.
 
 The project is meant to showcase the basic interaction between the front end and back end of an application, while also serving as a base that one can build off of for more serious projects. To run the code all you need is Express and Node installed along with the Multer dependency.
